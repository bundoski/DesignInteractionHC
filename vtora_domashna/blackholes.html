        <p class="text-white text-center mb-4" style="font-size:19px;">Black holes are objects in the universe with so
            much mass trapped inside their boundaries
            that they have incredibly
            strong gravitational fields. In fact, the gravitational force of a black hole is so strong that nothing can
            escape
            once it has gone inside. Not even light can escape a black hole, it is trapped inside along with stars, gas,
            and
            dust. Most black holes contain many times the mass of our Sun and the heaviest ones can have millions of
            solar masses.
            Despite all that mass, the actual singularity that forms the core of the black hole has never been seen or
            imaged. It is, as the word suggests, a tiny point in space, but it has a LOT of mass. Astronomers are only
            able to study these objects through their effect on the material that surrounds them.
            The material around the black hole forms a rotating disk that lies just beyond a
            region called "the event horizon," which is the gravitational point of no return.</p>
        <h3 class="text-white-50">The Structure of a Black Hole</h3>

        </div>
        <p class="text-white" style="font-size:19px;">The basic "building block" of the black hole is the singularity: a
            pinpoint region of space that contains all the mass of the black hole. Around it is a region of space from
            which light cannot escape, giving the "black hole" its name. The outer "edge" of this region is what forms
            the event horizon. It's the invisible boundary where the pull of the gravitational field is equal to the
            speed of light. It's also where gravity and light speed are balanced.

            The event horizon's position depends on the gravitational pull of the black hole. Astronomers calculate the
            location of an
            event horizon around a black hole using the equation Rs = 2GM/c2. R is the radius of the singularity, G is
            the force of
            gravity, M is the mass, c is the speed of light. </p>

            Micro black holes, on the other hand, could be created during the collision of two very high-energy
            particles. Scientists suggest this happens continuously in the upper atmosphere of Earth and is likely to
            happen during particle physics experiments at such places as CERN. </p>

        <div class="row">
            <hr class="text-white" style="width:60%;">
        </div>
        <p class="text-white" style="font-size:19px;">Since light can not escape from the region around a black hole
            affected by the event horizon, nobody can really "see" a black hole. However, astronomers can measure and
            characterize them by the effects they have on their surroundings. Black holes that are near other objects
            exert a gravitational effect on them. For one thing, mass can also be determined by the orbit of material
            around the black hole.</p>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col text-center">

        </div>
        <p class="text-white" style="font-size:19px">
            In practice, astronomers deduce the presence of the black hole by studying how light behaves around it.
            Black holes, like all massive objects, have enough gravitational pull to bend light's path as it passes by.
            As stars behind the black hole move relative to it, the light emitted by them will appear distorted, or the
            stars will appear to move in an unusual way. From this information, the position and mass of the black hole
            can be determined.

            This is especially apparent in galaxy clusters where the combined mass of the clusters, their dark matter,
            and their black holes create oddly-shaped arcs and rings by bending the light of more distant objects as it
            passes by.

            Astronomers can also see black holes by the radiation the heated material around them gives off, such as
            radio or x rays. The speed of that material also gives important clues to the characteristics of the black
            hole it's trying to escape.</p>


        <h3 class="text-white-50">Hawking Radiation</h3>
        <div class="row">
            <hr class="text-white" style="width:60%;">
        </div>
        <p class="text-white" style="font-size:19px">The final way that astronomers could possibly detect a black hole
            is through a mechanism known as Hawking radiation. Named for the famed theoretical physicist and cosmologist
            Stephen Hawking, Hawking radiation is a consequence of thermodynamics that requires that energy escape from
            a black hole.

            The basic idea is that, due to natural interactions and fluctuations in the vacuum, the matter will be
            created in the form of an electron and anti-electron (called a positron). When this occurs near the event
            horizon, one particle will be ejected away from the black hole, while the other will fall into the
            gravitational well.

            To an observer, all that is "seen" is a particle being emitted from the black hole. The particle would be
            seen as having positive energy. This means, by symmetry, that the particle that fell into the black hole
            would have negative energy. The result is that as a black hole ages, it loses energy, and therefore loses
            mass (by Einstein's famous equation, E=MC2, where E=energy, M=mass, and C is the speed of light).</p>

        <h3 class="text-white-50">Black Hole Types and How They Form</h3>
        <div class="row">

        </div>
        <p class="text-white" style="font-size:19px">
            There are different types of black holes, and they come about in different ways. The most common type is
            known as a stellar-mass black hole.
            These contain roughly up to a few times the mass of our Sun, and form when large main sequence stars (10 -
            15 times the mass of our Sun) run out of nuclear fuel in their cores. The result is a massive supernova
            explosion that blasts the stars outer layers to space. What's left behind collapses to create a black hole.
            The two other types of black holes are supermassive black holes (SMBH) and micro black holes. A single SMBH
            can contain the mass of millions or
            billions of suns. Micro black holes are, as their name implies, very tiny. They might have perhaps only 20
            micrograms of mass. In both cases, the
            mechanisms for their creation are not entirely clear. Micro black holes exist in theory but have not been
            directly detected.

            Supermassive black holes are found to exist in the cores of most galaxies and their origins are still hotly
            debated. It's possible that supermassive black
            holes are the result of a merger between smaller, stellar-mass black holes and other matter. Some
            astronomers suggest that they might be created when a single highly massive
            (hundreds of times the mass of the Sun) star collapses. Either way, they are massive enough to affect the
            galaxy in many ways, ranging from effects on
            starbirth rates to the orbits of stars and material in their near vicinity.

        </h3>
        <div class="row">
            <hr class="text-white" style="width:60%;">
        </div>
        <p class="text-white" style="font-size:19px">Because black holes swallow all light, astronomers can't spot them
            directly like they do the many glittery cosmic objects in the sky. But there are a few keys that reveal a
            black hole's presence.

            For one, a black hole's intense gravity tugs on any surrounding objects. Astronomers use these erratic
            movements to infer the presence of the invisible monster that lurks nearby. Or objects can orbit a black
            hole, and astronomers can look for stars that seem to orbit nothing to detect a likely candidate. That's how
            astronomers eventually identified Sagittarius A* as a black hole in the early 2000s.

            Black holes are also messy eaters, which often betrays their locations. As they sip on surrounding stars,
            their massive gravitational and magnetic forces superheat the infalling gas and dust, causing it to emit
            radiation. Some of this glowing matter envelops the black hole in a whirling region called an accretion
            disk. Even the matter that starts falling into a black hole isn't necessarily there to stay. Black holes can
            sometimes eject infalling stardust in mighty radiation-laden burps.

        </div>
        <p class="text-white" style="font-size:19px">When a star burns through the last of its fuel, the object may
            collapse, or fall into itself. For smaller stars (those up to about three times the sun's mass), the new
            core will become a neutron star or a white dwarf. But when a larger star collapses, it continues to compress
            and creates a stellar black hole.

            Black holes formed by the collapse of individual stars are relatively small but incredibly dense. One of
            these objects packs more than three times the mass of the sun into the diameter of a city. This leads to a
            crazy amount of gravitational force pulling on objects around the object. Stellar black holes then consume
            the dust and gas from their surrounding galaxies, which keeps them growing in size.

        <h3 class="text-white-50">Supermassive black holes — the birth of giants
        </h3>
        <div class="row">
            <hr class="text-white" style="width:60%;">
        </div>
        <p class="text-white" style="font-size:19px">Small black holes populate the universe, but their cousins,
            supermassive black holes, dominate. These enormous black holes are millions or even billions of times as
            massive as the sun but are about the same size in diameter. Such black holes are thought to lie at the
            center of pretty much every galaxy, including the Milky Way.

            Scientists aren't certain how such large black holes spawn. Once these giants have formed, they gather mass
            from the dust and gas around them, material that is plentiful in the center of galaxies, allowing them to
            grow to even more enormous sizes.

            Supermassive black holes may be the result of hundreds or thousands of tiny black holes that merge. Large
            gas clouds could also be responsible, collapsing together and rapidly accreting mass. A third option is the
            collapse of a stellar cluster, a group of stars all falling together. Fourth, supermassive black holes could
            arise from large clusters of dark matter. This is a substance that we can observe through its gravitational
            effect on other objects; however, we don't know what dark matter is composed of because it does not emit
            light and cannot be directly observed.

        <h3 class="text-white-50">Intermediate black holes
        </h3>
        <div class="row">
            <hr class="text-white" style="width:60%;">
        </div>
        <p class="text-white" style="font-size:19px">Scientists once thought that black holes came in only small and
            large sizes, but research has revealed the possibility that midsize, or intermediate, black holes (IMBHs)
            could exist. Such bodies could form when stars in a cluster collide in a chain reaction. Several of these
            IMBHs forming in the same region could then eventually fall together in the center of a galaxy and create a
            supermassive black hole.

            Advertisement
            In 2014, astronomers found what appeared to be an intermediate-mass black hole in the arm of a spiral
            galaxy. And in 2021 astronomers took advantage of an ancient gamma-ray burst to detect one.

            "Astronomers have been looking very hard for these medium-sized black holes," study co-author Tim Roberts,
            of the University of Durham in the United Kingdom, said in a statement. "There have been hints that they
            exist, but IMBHs have been acting like a long-lost relative that isn't interested in being found."

            Research, from 2018, suggested that these IMBHs may exist in the heart of dwarf galaxies (or very small
            galaxies). Observations of 10 such galaxies (five of which were previously unknown to science before this
            latest survey) revealed X-ray activity — common in black holes — suggesting the presence of black holes of
            from 36,000 to 316,000 solar masses. The information came from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, which examines
            about 1 million galaxies and can detect the kind of light often observed coming from black holes that are
            picking up nearby debris.

        </h3>
        <div class="row">
            <hr class="text-white" style="width:60%;">
        </div>
        <p class="text-white" style="font-size:19px">In 2015, astronomers using the Laser Interferometer
            Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) detected gravitational waves from merging stellar black holes.

            "We have further confirmation of the existence of stellar-mass black holes that are larger than 20 solar
            masses — these are objects we didn't know existed before LIGO detected them," David Shoemaker, the
            spokesperson for the LIGO Scientific Collaboration (LSC), said in a statement. LIGO's observations also
            provide insights into the direction a black hole spins. As two black holes spiral around one another, they
            can spin in the same direction or the opposite direction.

            There are two theories on how binary black holes form. The first suggests that the two black holes in a
            binary form at about the same time, from two stars that were born together and died explosively at about the
            same time. The companion stars would have had the same spin orientation as one another, so the two black
            holes left behind would as well.

            Advertisement
            Under the second model, black holes in a stellar cluster sink to the center of the cluster and pair up.
            These companions would have random spin orientations compared to one another according to LIGO Scientific
            Collaboration. LIGO's observations of companion black holes with different spin orientations provide
            stronger evidence for this formation theory.

            "We're starting to gather real statistics on binary black hole systems," said LIGO scientist Keita Kawabe of
            Caltech, who is based at the LIGO Hanford Observatory. "That's interesting because some models of black hole
            binary formation are somewhat favored over the others even now, and in the future, we can further narrow
            this down."
