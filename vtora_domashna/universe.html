        <p class="text-white text-center mb-4" style="font-size:19px;">It took quite a bit more than seven days to
            create the universe as we know it today. SPACE.com looks at the mysteries of the heavens in our eight-part
            series: The history & future of the cosmos. This is Part 5 in that series.

            Our universe was born about 13.7 billion years ago in a massive expansion that blew space up like a gigantic
            balloon.

            That, in a nutshell, is the Big Bang theory, which virtually all cosmologists and theoretical physicists
            endorse. The evidence supporting the idea is extensive and convincing. We know, for example, that the
            universe is still expanding even now, at an ever-accelerating rate.

            Scientists have also discovered a predicted thermal imprint of the Big Bang, the universe-pervading cosmic
            microwave background radiation. And we don't see any objects obviously older than 13.7 billion years,
            suggesting that our universe came into being around that time.

            "All of these things put the Big Bang on an extremely solid foundation," said astrophysicist Alex Filippenko
            of the University of California, Berkeley. "The Big Bang is an enormously successful theory."

            So what does this theory teach us? What really happened at the birth of our universe, and how did it take
            the shape we observe today?</p>
        <h3 class="text-white-50">The beginning</h3>
        <div class="row">
            <hr class="text-white" style="width:60%;">
        </div>
        <p class="text-white" style="font-size:19px;">Traditional Big Bang theory posits that our universe began with a
            singularity — a point of infinite density and temperature whose nature is difficult for our minds to grasp.
            However, this may not accurately reflect reality, researchers say, because the singularity idea is based on
            Einstein's theory of general relativity.

            "The problem is, there's no reason whatsoever to believe general relativity in that regime," said Sean
            Carroll, a theoretical physicist at Caltech. "It's going to be wrong, because it doesn't take into account
            quantum mechanics. And quantum mechanics is certainly going to be important once you get to that place in
            the history of the universe."

            So the very beginning of the universe remains pretty murky. Scientists think they can pick the story up at
            about 10 to the minus 36 seconds — one trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second — after the
            Big Bang.

            At that point, they believe, the universe underwent an extremely brief and dramatic period of inflation,
            expanding faster than the speed of light. It doubled in size perhaps 100 times or more, all within the span
            of a few tiny fractions of a second.

            (Inflation may seem to violate the theory of special relativity, but that's not the case, scientists say.
            Special relativity holds that no information or matter can be carried between two points in space faster
            than the speed of light. But inflation was an expansion of space itself.)

            "Inflation was the 'bang' of the Big Bang," Filippenko told SPACE.com "Before inflation, there was just a
            little bit of stuff, quite possibly, expanding just a little bit. We needed something like inflation to make
            the universe big."

            This rapidly expanding universe was pretty much empty of matter, but it harbored huge amounts of dark
            energy, the theory goes. Dark energy is the mysterious force that scientists think is driving the universe's
            current accelerating expansion.

            During inflation, dark energy made the universe smooth out and accelerate. But it didn't stick around for
            long.

            "It was just temporary dark energy," Carroll told SPACE.com. "It converted into ordinary matter and
            radiation through a process called reheating. The universe went from being cold during inflation to being
            hot again when all the dark energy went away."

            Scientists don't know what might have spurred inflation. That remains one of the key questions in Big Bang
            cosmology, Filippenko said. </p>

        <p class="text-white" style="font-size:19px;">Most cosmologists regard inflation as the leading theory for
            explaining the universe's characteristics — specifically, why it's relatively flat and homogeneous, with
            roughly the same amount of stuff spread out equally in all directions.

            Various lines of evidence point toward inflation being a reality, said theoretical physicist Andy Albrecht
            of the University of California, Davis.

            Advertisement
            "They all hang together pretty nicely with the inflationary picture," said Albrecht, one of the architects
            of inflation theory. "Inflation has done incredibly well."

            However, inflation is not the only idea out there that tries to explain the universe's structure. Theorists
            have come up with another one, called the cyclic model, which is based on an earlier concept called the
            ekpyrotic universe.

            This idea holds that our universe didn't emerge from a single point, or anything like it. Rather, it bounced
            into expansion — at a much more sedate pace than the inflation theory predicts — from a pre-existing
            universe that had been contracting. If this theory is correct, our universe has likely undergone an endless
            succession of bangs and crunches.

            "The beginning of our universe would have been nice and finite," said Burt Ovrut of the University of
            Pennsylvania, one of the originators of ekpyrotic theory.

            The cyclic model posits that our universe consists of 11 dimensions, only four of which we can observe
            (three of space and one of time). Our four-dimensional part of the universe is called a brane (short for
            membrane).

            There could be other branes lurking out there in 11-dimensional space, the idea goes. A collision between
            two branes could have jolted the universe from contraction to expansion, spurring the Big Bang we see
            evidence of today. </p>

        <h3 class="text-white-50">The universe we know takes shape</h3>

        </div>
        <p class="text-white" style="font-size:19px;">But first, how did our universe spring up out of nothing?
            Cosmologists suspect that the four forces that rule the universe — gravity, electromagnetism and the weak
            and strong nuclear forces — were unified into a single force at the universe's birth, squashed together
            because of the extreme temperatures and densities involved.

            Advertisement
            But things changed as the universe expanded and cooled. Around the time of inflation, the strong force
            likely separated out. And by about 10 trillionths of a second after the Big Bang, the electromagnetic and
            weak forces became distinct, too.

            Just after inflation, the universe was likely filled with a hot, dense plasma. But by around 1 microsecond
            (10 to the minus 6 seconds) or so, it had cooled enough to allow the first protons and neutrons to form,
            researchers think.

            In the first three minutes after the Big Bang, these protons and neutrons began fusing together, forming
            deuterium (also known as heavy hydrogen). Deuterium atoms then joined up with each other, forming helium-4.

        <h3 class="text-white-50">Before the big bang?</h3>
        <div class="row">
            <hr class="text-white" style="width:60%;">
        </div>
        <p class="text-white" style="font-size:19px;">While much about the universe's first few moments remains
            speculative, the question of what preceded the Big Bang is even more mysterious and hard to tackle.

            For starters, the question itself may be nonsensical. If the universe came from nothing, as some theorists
            believe, the Big Bang marks the instant when time itself began. In that case, there would be no such thing
            as "before," Carroll said.

            But some conceptions of the universe's birth can propose possible answers. The cyclic model, for example,
            suggests that a contracting universe preceded our expanding one. Carroll, as well, can imagine something
            existing before the Big Bang.

            "It could just be empty space that existed before our Big Bang happened, then some quantum fluctuation gave
            birth to a universe like ours," he said. "You can imagine a little bubble of space pinching off through a
            fluctuation and being filled with just a little tiny dollop of energy, which can then grow into the universe
            that we see through inflation."

            Filippenko also suspects something along those lines might be true.

            "I think time in our universe started with the Big Bang, but I think we were a fluctuation from a
            predecessor, a mother universe," Filippenko said.
