        <p class="text-white text-center mb-4" style="font-size:19px;">General relativity is physicist Albert Einstein's
            understanding of how gravity affects the fabric of space-time.

            The theory, which Einstein published in 1915, expanded the theory of special relativity that he had
            published 10 years earlier. Special relativity argued that space and time are inextricably connected, but
            that theory didn't acknowledge the existence of gravity.

            Einstein spent the decade between the two publications determining that particularly massive objects warp
            the fabric of space-time, a distortion that manifests as gravity, according to NASA.

        <h3 class="text-white-50">How does general relativity work?</h3>
        <div class="row">
            <hr class="text-white" style="width:60%;">
        </div>
        <p class="text-white" style="font-size:19px;">To understand general relativity, first, let's start with gravity,
            the force of attraction that two objects exert on one another. Sir Isaac Newton quantified gravity in the
            same text in which he formulated his three laws of motion, the "Principia."

            The gravitational force tugging between two bodies depends on how massive each one is and how far apart the
            two lie, according to NASA. Even as the center of the Earth is pulling you toward it (keeping you firmly
            lodged on the ground), your center of mass is pulling back at the Earth. But the more massive body barely
            feels the tug from you, while with your much smaller mass you find yourself firmly rooted thanks to that
            same force. Yet Newton's laws assume that gravity is an innate force of an object that can act over a
            distance.

            Albert Einstein, in his theory of special relativity, determined that the laws of physics are the same for
            all non-accelerating observers, and he showed that the speed of light within a vacuum is the same no matter
            the speed at which an observer travels, according to Wired.

            As a result, he found that space and time were interwoven into a single continuum known as space-time. And
            events that occur at the same time for one observer could occur at different times for another.
            As he worked out the equations for his general theory of relativity, Einstein realized that massive objects
            caused a distortion in space-time. Imagine setting a large object in the center of a trampoline. The object
            would press down into the fabric, causing it to dimple. If you then attempt to roll a marble around the edge
            of the trampoline, the marble would spiral inward toward the body, pulled in much the same way that the
            gravity of a planet pulls at rocks in space.

        <p class="text-white" style="font-size:19px;">
            Light bends around a massive object, such as a black hole, causing it to act as a lens for the things that
            lie behind it. Astronomers routinely use this method to study stars and galaxies behind massive objects.

            The Einstein Cross, a quasar in the Pegasus constellation, according to the European Space Agency (ESA), and
            is an excellent example of gravitational lensing. The quasar is seen as it was about 11 billion years ago;
            the galaxy that it sits behind is about 10 times closer to Earth. Because the two objects align so
            precisely, four images of the quasar appear around the galaxy because the intense gravity of the galaxy
            bends the light coming from the quasar.
            In cases like Einstein's cross, the different images of the gravitationally lensed object appear
            simultaneously, but that isn't always the case. Scientists have also managed to observe lensing examples
            where, because the light traveling around the lens takes different paths of different lengths, different
            images arrive at different times, as in the case of one particularly interesting supernova.
