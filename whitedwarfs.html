        <p class="text-white text-center mb-4" style="font-size:19px;">White dwarfs are what is left when stars like our
            sun have exhausted all of their fuel. They are dense, dim, stellar corpses — the last observable stage of
            evolution for low- and medium-mass stars.

            Whilst most massive stars will eventually go supernova, a low or medium mass star with a mass less than
            about 8 times the mass of the sun will eventually become a white dwarf, according to NASA. Approximately 97%
            of the stars in the Milky Way will eventually become white dwarfs, according to researchers.

            Compared to our sun, a white dwarf has a similar carbon and oxygen mass though it is much smaller in size —
            similar to Earth, according to New Mexico State University (NMSU).
            White dwarf temperatures can exceed 100,000 Kelvin according to NASA (that's about 179,500 degrees
            Fahrenheit). Despite these sweltering temperatures, white dwarfs have a low luminosity as they're so small
            in size according to NMSU.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="text-white" style="font-size:19px;">Main-sequence stars, including the sun, form from clouds of dust
            and gas drawn together by gravity. How the stars evolve through their lifetime depends on their mass. The
            most massive stars, with eight times the mass of the sun or more, will never become white dwarfs. Instead,
            at the end of their lives, white dwarfs will explode in a violent supernova, leaving behind a neutron star
            or black hole.
            Smaller stars, however, will take a slightly more sedate path. Low- to medium-mass stars, such as the sun,
            will eventually swell up into red giants. After that, the stars shed their outer layers into a ring known as
            a planetary nebula (early observers thought the nebulas resembled planets such as Neptune and Uranus ). The
            core that is left behind will be a white dwarf, a husk of a star in which no hydrogen fusion occurs.
            Smaller stars, such as red dwarfs, don't make it to the red giant state. They simply burn through all of
            their hydrogen, ending the process as a dim white dwarf. However, red dwarfs take trillions of years to
            consume their fuel, far longer than the 13.8-billion-year-old age of the universe, so no red dwarfs have yet
            become white dwarfs. </p>

        </div>
        <p class="text-white" style="font-size:19px;">When a star runs out of fuel, it no longer experiences an outward
            push from the process of fusion and it collapses inward on itself. White dwarfs contain approximately the
            mass of the sun but have roughly the radius of Earth, according to Cosmos, the astronomy encyclopedia from
            Swinburne University in Australia. This makes them among the densest objects in space, beaten out only by
            neutron stars and black holes. According to NASA, the gravity on the surface of a white dwarf is 350,000
            times that of gravity on Earth. That means a 150-pound (68-kilogram) person on Earth would weigh 50 million
            pounds (22.7 million kg) on the surface of a white dwarf.
            White dwarfs reach this incredible density because they are collapsed so tightly that their electrons are
            smashed together, forming what is called "degenerate matter." The former stars will keep collapsing until
            the electrons themselves provide enough of an outward-pressing force to halt the crunch. The more mass, the
            greater the pull inward, so a more massive white dwarf has a smaller radius than its less massive
            counterpart. Those conditions mean that, after shedding much of its mass during the red giant phase, no
            white dwarf can exceed 1.4 times the mass of the sun.

            When a star swells up to become a red giant, it engulfs its closest planets. But some can still survive.
            NASA’s Spitzer spacecraft revealed that at least 1 to 3 percent of white dwarf stars have contaminated
            atmospheres that suggest rocky material has fallen into them.
            "In the quest for Earth-like planets, we have now identified numerous systems which are excellent candidates
            to harbor them," Jay Farihi, a white dwarf researcher at the University of Leicester in England, told
            Space.com. "Where they persist as white dwarfs, any terrestrial planets will not be habitable, but may have
            been sites where life developed during a previous epoch."

            In one exciting case, researchers have observed the rocky material as it falls into the white dwarf. </p>

        <h3 class="text-white-50">The fate of a white dwarf</h3>
        <div class="row">
            <hr class="text-white" style="width:60%;">
        </div>
        <p class="text-white" style="font-size:19px;">Many white dwarfs fade away into relative obscurity, eventually
            radiating away all of their energy and becoming so-called black dwarfs, but those that share a system with
            companion stars may suffer a different fate.

            If the white dwarf is part of a binary system, it may be able to pull material from its companion onto its
            surface. Increasing the white dwarf's mass can have some interesting results.

            One possibility is that the added mass could cause it to collapse into a much denser neutron star.

            A far more explosive result is the Type 1a supernova. As the white dwarf pulls material from a companion
            star, the temperature increases, eventually triggering a runaway reaction that detonates in a violent
            supernova that destroys the white dwarf. This process is known as a "single-degenerate model" of a Type 1a
            supernova.
            In 2012, researchers were able to closely observe the complex shells of gas surrounding one Type 1a
            supernova in fine detail.

            "We really saw, for the first time, detailed evidence of the progenitor for a Type 1a supernova," Benjamin
            Dilday, the study's lead author and an astronomer at Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network in
            California told SPACE.com.

            If the companion is another white dwarf instead of an active star, the two stellar corpses merge together to
            kick off the fireworks. This process is known as a "double-degenerate model" of a Type 1a supernova.

            At other times, the white dwarf may pull just enough material from its companion to briefly ignite in a
            nova, a far smaller explosion. Because the white dwarf remains intact, it can repeat the process several
            times when it reaches that critical point, breathing life back into the dying star over and over again.

            "These are the brightest and most frequent stellar eruptions in the galaxy, and they're often visible to the
            naked eye," Przemek Mróz, an astronomer at Poland’s Warsaw University, told Space.com in a previous article.
